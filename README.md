# Quietplace

## Why

I always wanted a place I can use as default page for new tabs on my web browsers, without any dependencies such as extensions. 
Momentum is a great plugin but infortunately not available for safari, and it doesn't respond all my needs.
So I decided to create my own page, that I set as default page on my browser, so I don't need any extension. 

## Installation
* All needed to be done is to point the homepage of the browser to the location of ```unsplash.html``` file.
